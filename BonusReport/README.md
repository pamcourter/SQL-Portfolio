# Bonus Report
### TASK - the WFM team has been generating this report manually by downloading data from various CRM sources, transforming the data and copying into this excel spreadsheet that uses formulas to complete the calculations. However, downloading the data and transforming it is taking a long time and even the smallest mis-alignment of copy and pasting cells results in a lot of errors that are hard to catch. The task was to import the data files into SQL Server and generate a report similar to the base report. While we were not given access to these reports, the WFM team sent them to us in Excel via email. Using an inhouse process to collect the reports from email and import to the SQL server, I set up the process parameters and import/update stored procedures to transform the data as needed and upload to the sql server tables. From there I prepared SQL stored procedures to be used by SSRS reporting to generate a similar report.

##### Here is the report I was able to generate. However, some of the data needed for the report was from manually tracked files the WFM team preferred to copy and paste manually still, so I had to devise a way to incorporate the data they added manually into the final report calculations. Also wanting to avoid mistakes in pasting, I formatted the cells that required input as a light green. Once the report was ran in SSRS and downloaded as an excel file and the data was added in, the formula was activated to incorporate those values. If a mistake was made and the formula overwritten, it could be reran again without losing the formulas. Also, if there was a change in calculation, rather than making the change manually in the excel file, I could easily change it within the ssrs report file.
